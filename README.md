### Company Introduction
Apprentice Chef, Inc. is an innovative company with a unique spin on cooking at home. Developed for the busy professional that has little to no skills in the kitchen, they offer a wide selection of daily-prepared gourmet meals delivered directly to your door. Each meal set takes at most 30 minutes to finish cooking at home and also comes with Apprentice Chef's award-winning disposable cookware (i.e. pots, pans, baking trays, and utensils), allowing for fast and easy cleanup. Ordering meals is very easy given their user-friendly online platform and mobile app.

### Case Context
In an effort to diversify their revenue stream, Apprentice Chef, Inc. has launched Halfway There, a cross-selling promotion where subscribers receive a half bottle of wine from a local California vineyard every Wednesday (halfway through the work week). The executives at Apprentice Chef also believe this endeavor will create a competitive advantage based on its unique product offering of hard to find local wines.
Halfway There has been exclusively offered to all of the customers in the dataset I received, and the executives would like to promote this service to a wider audience. They have tasked me to:
- Analyze the data
- Develop my top insights
- Build a machine learning model to predict which customers will subscribe to the Halfway There service

In order to appropriately prepare the data for this analysis, the data science team at Apprentice Chef has queried, sampled, and verified a dataset of approximately 2,000 customers. Each customer met at least one of the following criteria:
1. At least one purchase per month for a total of 11 of their first 12 months
2. At least one purchase per quarter and at least 15 purchases throughout their first year

The data science team assures me that their dataset engineering techniques are statistically sound and represent the true picture of Apprentice Chefâ€™s customers. To help me in my task, Apprentice Chef, Inc. has provided me with the dataset and additional information about the company.
